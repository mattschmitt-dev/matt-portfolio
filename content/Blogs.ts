In the Bitcoin network, there are different types of nodes. The first type is full nodes, which play a crucial role in supporting and securing the Bitcoin blockchain. These nodes verify transactions and blocks based on the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. They are essential for the network to function properly.</p><p id="0a03" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nw nx hi ny b ig nz oa ob ij oc od oe of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or gm bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Another type of node is called <mark class="ya yb ao">listening nodes or supernodes</mark>. These are full nodes that are publicly visible and accessible. They can communicate with all the node that connects to them. They provide blockchain data to other nodes and can also serve as communication bridges between nodes.</p><p id="5bae" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nw nx hi ny b ig nz oa ob ij oc od oe of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or gm bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Mining nodes are specifically dedicated to mining Bitcoin.

Each block includes a hashed reference to all the data that came before it in the chain. This means that if someone wanted to alter a record on the blockchain, they would have to change every single block, which is nearly impossible. Furthermore, the blockchain is not stored in a single location but is distributed across the computers of all the blockchain users, making it even more secure.</p><p id="74d5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nw nx hi ny b ig nz oa ob ij oc od oe of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or gm bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">In summary, the sequential arrangement of blocks, their unique references, and the decentralized storage of the blockchain's data makes it highly resistant to hacking and fraud.</p></div></div></div>

This digital ledger is safe, secure, transparent, and decentralized, which simply means that it is not controlled by a single authority. It is like a ledger that a bank uses to keep track of all customer transactions. However, in a bank, the ledger is controlled by the bank, and only the bank can see the transactions. Whereas in blockchain, there is no central authority, and the ledger runs on multiple computers and doesn't require any single person to authenticate or settle transactions.</p><p id="ed9f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nk nl gt nm b nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh gm bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let's try to understand how Blockchain works through a real-life analogy.

Whenever someone edits or modifies the spreadsheet, it gets updated automatically on every computer on the network. Thus, the spreadsheet is updated in real-time, and a single version of the spreadsheet is always visible to everyone on the network.</p><p id="faa6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nk nl gt nm b nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh gm bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">On the contrary, if you put data on an Excel sheet on your computer, it is just one file that has to be shared with the other people on the network by emailing them. If one makes some modifications in the Excel sheet, the modified file has to be saved and emailed to other recipients. Sometimes, many versions of a single Excel sheet are created, and it is quite possible to lose track of the most recent versions of the document and wind up updating old versions of the Excel sheet.

It has even been viewed as a revolutionary technology that will decentralize the web.

This feature of decentralization eliminates the need to rely on any third party or middlemen for these transactions. Thus, cutting down the high transaction fees charged by these third-party service providers. For instance, when you transfer a sum of money to your friend, you have to rely on a bank to perform this task.

The word distributed ledger is composed of two terms — Distributed and Ledger.

The distributed ledger contains the record of each and every transaction that took place over the network.</p><p id="68c3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nk nl gt nm b nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh gm bj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><mark class="vj vk ao">And every node of the network has access to a copy of this updated ledger.

Immutability means something that can't be changed or altered. Once the data has been recorded inside a Blockchain, it becomes nearly impossible to change it, thus making it tamper-proof and immutable. To better understand the concept of immutability, let us take the example of an email. Once you share a document in an email with a group of your friends, you can not take it back. The only way to do this is to ask all of your friends to delete that email which is quite difficult. This is exactly how immutability works in the Blockchain network. This is very important when you want to trust something or when you want to make something more trustable. For example, suppose you have built a database on your computer, and if you want to change data because everything is in your control, you can change the data and change the data in any way you want to. But with blockchain, that is not possible.</p><h2 id="6" class="pz ov gt be ow qa qb dx pa qc qd dz pe nv qe qf qg nz qh qi qj od qk ql qm qn bj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="al">4.

Double spending is simply the risk that a user may spend the same currency units twice. Double spending is a potential loophole specifically applicable to digital currencies. Suppose you go to a cafe and order coffee worth $5. You pay in cash. The service provider at the cafe confirms that you have paid, and you receive your coffee in exchange for the money. Now, is it possible to spend the same $5 somewhere else to make another purchase? The answer is NO. The double-spending problem never arises in physical currency. But unlike physical currencies, a digital currency consists of digital information which can be reproduced or duplicated easily. In the case of digital currency, a currency holder can make a copy of the digital token. He will now have 2 copies of the same token. He can send one token to a merchant while keeping the original token with himself. Thus, spending the digital currency twice by its owner.</p><p id="2f07" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nk nl gt nm b nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh gm bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Double-spending was one of the very serious concerns with Bitcoin initially because there was no central authority to verify that a token is spent only once.</p><p id="47b3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nk nl gt nm b nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh gm bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let's take another real-life scenario to understand the double-spending of digital currency better — Suppose you went on a trip with your friend and clicked his photo on your mobile. He asked you to share his picture with him through WhatsApp. You shared his picture on his demand, but now there are two copies of the same picture — one is with him, and one is with you. This is a classic example of understanding the issue of double-spending. In traditional online transactions, banks are the centralized authorities that ensure no double-spending.</p><p id="667c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nk nl gt nm b nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh gm bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Blockchain, being decentralized, found a solution for double-spending through the consensus mechanism. The consensus mechanism requires users to vote on valid transactions, and only then these transactions get appended to the latest block.</p><p id="b237" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nk nl gt nm b nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh gm bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let us understand it through an example — there are three persons Phil, Lyra, and Matt. Lyra has 1 Bitcoin with her. Lyra sends that Bitcoin to Phil. Simultaneously, Lyra does another transaction and sends the same Bitcoin to Matt as well. The second transaction will be rejected by the participating nodes on Blockchain. Every transaction before getting committed to the Blockchain is verified against the ledger records by the nodes. So in the first case, when Lyra sends money to Phil, the transaction will be validated against the ledger, which will show that Lyra has one Bitcoin with her, which means that she can transfer her one Bitcoin to Phil. Thus, making it a valid transaction. But in the second transaction, which Lyra does to Matt when the transaction is validated against the ledger, it gets rejected as there is no Bitcoin left with Lyra, so she can't make any transaction to Matt.</p><p id="f0f5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nk nl gt nm b nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh gm bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Thus, mitigating the problem of double-spending.</p><blockquote class="qt qu qv"><p id="d13c" class="nk nl oi nm b nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh gm bj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="nm gu">If you liked this article and want to know more about Blockchain, NFTs, Metaverse, and their applications, click the below link.</strong></p></blockquote><div class="rc ab iw"><div class="rd ab cn ca re rf"><div class="ri l"><h3 class="be b in z je rg jg jh rh jj jl dt"></h3></div><div class="rj l"></div></div><div class="rk l"><div class="rl l rm rn ro rk rp md rb"></div></div></div></a></div><p id="916c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nk nl gt nm b nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh gm bj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="nm gu">Happy learning!</strong></p></div>`,
