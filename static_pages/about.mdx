I'm a full-stack & blockchain developer with 7+ years of experience building scalable, end-to-end applications using technologies like Solidity, Rust, Move, Haskell, Foundry, React, Next.js, and Node.js. I specialize in developing Smart Contracts, staking systems, trading bots, web wallets, NFT games, marketplaces, robust APIs, and secure cloud-native deployments. Leveraging deep expertise in Ethereum, Solana, Sui, Cardano, and Midnight, I develop innovative dApps that drive the evolution of the Web3 ecosystem.
